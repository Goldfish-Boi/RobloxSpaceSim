# RobloxSpaceSim
All of the scripts I've made for my roblox space simulator!

Enter the name of any of the eight planets (plus the sun!) in the solar system to view the following:
- Rotation tilt
- Rotational Period
- Accurate orbits of major moons
- Accurate sizes and scales

Use additonal buttons to explore the celestial bodies in each system!
Earth is loaded in by default.

Default time scale: 1s = 1hr
Default size scale: 1stud = 1000km
